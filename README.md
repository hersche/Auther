# AGAIN WIP (work in progress)

Auther is a project for provide kind of "user-directory".

The problem i often hear about, is that people dislike to remember various Accounts.

The solution i try to do is similiar to a lot of apps out there - one auth-server, all the apps using this one. To stay flexible, the project has only generic useable features.

A

   npm install

is needed for this project. After all options in .env starting with MIX, you need to recompile the JavaScript with

   npm run dev
   
or

   npm run prod
